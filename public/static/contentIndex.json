One big problem though is that I hate writing.\nIâ€™ve wanted this for years yet I havenâ€™t started it yet because I end up obsessing over stupid details like:\n\nwhat static site generator am I gonna use?\n\nJekyll?\nmdbook?\ndocusaurus?\nHugo?\nZola?\nnextjs SSR with app router + MDX ?\nObsidian publish ($8 USD/mo)\nquartz\nhow am I gonna sync the notes? Iâ€™d like to have the blog in Obsidian but also not publish personal notes\n\n\n\n, resulting in decision paralysis and then never getting started. Itâ€™s also more fun to think about over-engineering a solution rather than writing.\nToday I decided to just start writing a first post. Itâ€™s gotta start somewhere and this is it. To be honest this post is already longer than I thought it was gonna be. Iâ€™m typing it on my phone before I go to bed. This text likely wonâ€™t be public for a while until I figure out how I want to host this. Recently, I decided to write some self-reflection notes at the end of the day in Obsidian to get into the habit of giving myself some time to do that. Today, I decided if I want to have a stereotypical programmer blog, itâ€™s gotta start somewhere, so here is my first post.\nGood night ðŸ’¤\nOriginally written: 2024-06-18\nLast modified: 2024-06-18\nBlog Home"},"blog/You-too-can-use-Arch,-BTW":{"title":"You too can use Arch, BTW","links":["blog/"],"tags":[],"content":"Nothing to see here, this is a work in progress\nOriginally written: 2024-06-18\nLast modified: 2024-06-18\nBlog Home"},"blog/index":{"title":"Blog","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"title":"Arun's Website","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is not a typical website.
